# Discourse to Discord Webhook

This PHP script acts an intermediary between Discourse and Discord, receiving webhooks from Discourse and parsing them into an optimal format before relaying them to Discord.

## Demo

See it in action and test it out for yourself on [Crit Cola's Discourse](https://critcola.com/community/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=demo&utm_content=discourse-to-discord-webhook&utm_campaign=development) and [Discord](https://discord.critcola.com).

## Installation

Just clone it!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/critcola/discourse-to-discord-webhook.git
```

This has been tested with and is supported on PHP 7.1, but should work fine on older versions of PHP.

## Configuration

Copy `config-template.php` to `config.php` and populate all non-optional variables after configuring webhooks in both Discourse and Discord.
